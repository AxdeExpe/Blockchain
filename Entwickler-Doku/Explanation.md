- The blockchain always begins with the genesis block, which is created once the chain is first put into operation. After that, additional blocks can be added

- A sidechain can be created if one wants to work relatively independently from the main blockchain or if one wants to create their own blockchain

- These sidechains can exist indefinitely and do not require ongoing communication with the main blockchain
- If a sidechain is to be taken offline, however, it must again interact with the main blockchain; otherwise, the sidechain will continue to exist indefinitely
- You can still read from the blocks of the sidechain even if it's offline, but no longer write to it
